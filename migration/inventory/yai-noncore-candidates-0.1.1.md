## Keep In YAI (Runtime/Core)

- `boot/`, `root/`, `kernel/`, `engine/`, `mind/`, `runtime/`, `law/`
- runtime-facing docs: `docs/user-guide`, `docs/getting-started`, `docs/architecture` (where runtime-specific)
- build artifacts and release bundle outputs strictly tied to runtime binaries

## Migration Principle

- Move governance/process/cross-repo assets to `infra`.
- Keep only thin compatibility wrappers in `yai/tools/bin` where needed.
- Keep only thin compatibility wrappers in `yai/tools/{ops,release,data,dev,bundle}` where required.
- Avoid duplicate canonical docs/templates across repos.
